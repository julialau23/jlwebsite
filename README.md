# jlwebsite
The html, css, and javascript source code for my personal website.

The index.html text file contains the structure of the website. I used flexbox to align my text/images.
main.css contains all the css for the code and responsive design, and app.js contains the back-end code for features such as 
text fading in/out, a loading page, and some responsive design.
